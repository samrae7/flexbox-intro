# Quick intro to Flexbox
A very basic introduction to flexbox css.

## Setup
If you have python cli installed on your machine (check by running `python --version` in terminal) run:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

to serve the webpage (it will default to `localhost:8000`).

If not you'll need some other simple web server to serve the html file.

## How to use
Uncomment the css after each heading, save the file and reload the web page to see what effect that has. After that you can play about with the styling using your browser's dev tools.
